# Modeling and Analyzing UConn E-SPIN SJI Student Responses

This semester-long independent study (CSE 4099) with Dr. Matthew Lamoureux applies machine learning and data science techniques to examine how students' self-identified neurodivergence and gender relate to their responses on the Engineeering Student Preferences in Navigation Situational Judgement Inventory (E-SPIN SJI). 

The goal is to identify patterns in how students navigate situational choices, providing insights that can guide Dr. Stephany Santos and the Vergnano Institute for Inclusion (VII) in developing more effective ways to engage engineering students.
